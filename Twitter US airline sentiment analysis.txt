1. Introduction
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of customer sentiment regarding US airlines, using Twitter data, alongside a simulated flight delay prediction model. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights from both unstructured text (tweets) and structured operational data (simulated flight records). This helps in understanding customer pain points, predicting flight disruptions, and informing strategic business decisions for airlines.

2. Dataset Overview
The project leverages two main datasets:

Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset: Contains over 14,000 tweets classified into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments. It includes confidence scores, reasons for negative sentiment, and various tweet metadata.

Simulated Flight Delay Dataset: A synthetically generated dataset that mirrors real-world flight operations. It includes scheduled departure/arrival times, origin/destination airports, airline, flight duration, actual delay minutes, and delay reasons. This dataset is crucial for simulating predictive analytics and operational scenarios.

3. Key Features & Methodology
This project employs a multi-faceted approach, combining data science, machine learning, and visualization techniques:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Handles data loading, cleaning of tweet text (removing noise, tokenization, lemmatization), and feature engineering from datetime columns for both datasets. It also includes one-hot encoding and standard scaling for flight data.

Flight Delay Prediction: Develops a machine learning pipeline using RandomForestClassifier to predict flight delays, providing evaluation metrics like classification_report and accuracy_score.

Counterfactual Analysis: Simulates "what if" scenarios (e.g., "what if a flight departed 1 hour earlier?") to analyze the impact on delay probability.

Business Impact & Recommendations: Quantifies potential monetary losses due to delays and estimates savings through mitigation strategies. It offers data-driven recommendations for operational improvements and optimal buffer times.

Geospatial Visualization: Utilizes Folium to map flight delay hotspots and visualize patterns of delayed routes on an interactive map.

Passenger-Centric Analytics:

Impact on Connections: Identifies potential missed connections resulting from arriving flight delays.

Sentiment Correlation: Explores relationships between flight delays and spikes in negative customer feedback from tweets.

Advanced Modeling & Explainability (for Sentiment Analysis):

Ensemble Models: Implements VotingClassifier and StackingClassifier for enhanced sentiment prediction.

Deep Learning: Builds and trains LSTM and GRU models for sentiment classification.

Transformers: Demonstrates the use of pre-trained models (like DistilBERT) for sentiment analysis.

Model Explainability: Uses SHAP, LIME, and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) to interpret model predictions, showing which words drive sentiment and how features influence outcomes.

5. Key Insights & Findings
Dominant Negative Sentiment: Customer tweets show a strong negative bias, often due to "Customer Service Issues" and "Late Flights."

Predictive Power: The delay prediction model effectively identifies potential flight delays, highlighting the value of operational data.

Monetary Impact: Delays incur significant costs, and predictive models can lead to substantial monetary savings.

Geospatial Hotspots: Specific airports and routes are identified as consistent delay hotspots, guiding targeted interventions.

Delay-Sentiment Correlation: A clear link exists between flight delays and increased negative sentiment, especially "Late Flight" complaints, underscoring the need for proactive communication.

Explainability: Tools like SHAP and LIME provide clear insights into why models make certain predictions, identifying key words and factors influencing sentiment.
